# How it works
We are using Spotify´s API.

Thanks to it we can access the 20 last songs you played. Feel like partying, happy and excited? Don´t worry we arleady know how you feel!

Once we have accessed your current played songs we can predict your behaviour with an interesting audio feautre for every track: danceability, energy and tempo.
