# How it works
We are using Spotify´s API.

Thanks to it we can access the last 20 songs you played. Feel like partying, happy and excited? Don´t worry we arleady know how you feel!

Once we have accessed your current played songs we can predict your behaviour with an interesting audio feautre for every track: danceability, energy and tempo.

From there our algorithm can predict how you are feeling lately and your favorite music genre. We can connect with other people who have similar music interest based on these features.
